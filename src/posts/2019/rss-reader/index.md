# Why RSS + the best reader app

![Feedly](./assets/feedly.png "The Feedly web app")

[RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) (Really Simple Syndication) feeds offer a private, relatively decentralized means of aggregating content from your favorite news sites and blogs. A raw feed ([click here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss) for an example from The Guardian) is typically a dump of the most recent articles by a web publisher. You can plug these feeds into a reader app of your choice. You curate your own experience and trusted sources - no one else is in charge of what you consume. That's what's great about RSS.

There are no shortage of posts about RSS reader apps. The Sweet Setup, in particular, has a great, [in-depth review](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-rss-reader-os-x/) of the best RSS app for macOS (they advocate for [Reeder 4](https://reederapp.com/)). However, after trying out their recommendations, and doing a little research of my own, I settled on [Feedly](https://feedly.com) as my reader of choice.

My criteria for what makes a good reader:

1. Fetch older data not in the current feed state
2. Free or one-time purchase (no subscription-only)
3. Folder organization
4. Reader view (aka Mercury Parser)

\#1 is the biggest for me. One of the limitations of RSS is that it usually provides the most recent 10-20 articles, as set by the web publisher. However, I’d like an RSS reader that can let me browse entire archives without use of a full web browser. [Google Reader](https://gcemetery.co/google-reader/) was able to do this (RIP), and so can Feedly and [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/). The latter two are not just web and mobile apps, but also services that cache RSS feeds from the point they are first submitted by _any_ user.

Until “non-service” apps like Reeder can load older data, Feedly and Inoreader are the best bet. They also meet the other listed criteria. What breaks the tie between them? Although their free-tier web apps are comparable, Feedly’s iOS app is less clunky than Inoreader’s (but still not great), which gives it the edge.
